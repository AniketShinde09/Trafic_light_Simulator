**Traffic Light Simulation with Pedestrian and Emergency Override**

This is a simple traffic light simulation built using React. The system features a standard traffic light sequence, a pedestrian button to request a crossing, and an optional emergency override that immediately switches to green for emergency vehicles.

### [Live Demo](https://trafic-light-simulator-k3zhv4l7y-anikets-projects-a642f60e.vercel.app/)

**Features**

Standard Traffic Light Sequence:
Green light: 10 seconds
Yellow light: 3 seconds
Red light: 7 seconds

**Tech Stack**
React: The JavaScript library used to build the user interface.
CSS: For styling the components and ensuring the UI is responsive and visually appealing.
JavaScript (ES6+): Used to implement the logic and component-based structure of the app.
React Hooks: Utilized useState, useEffect, and useCallback for managing component states and effects.
Node.js & npm: For managing dependencies and running the development server.
