**Traffic Light Simulation with Pedestrian and Emergency Override**

This is a simple traffic light simulation built using React. The system features a standard traffic light sequence, a pedestrian button to request a crossing, and an optional emergency override that immediately switches to green for emergency vehicles.

**Features**

Standard Traffic Light Sequence:
Green light: 10 seconds
Yellow light: 3 seconds
Red light: 7 seconds

Pedestrian Button:
Allows pedestrians to request the traffic light to turn red for 5 seconds after the current cycle.

Emergency Override Button:
Switches the traffic light to green for 5 seconds, interrupting any ongoing sequence.
